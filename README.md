#NYC Subway Data Analysis

This project is part of Udacity's Big Data Foundations Nanodegree. The analysis involves exploring NYC subway data to uncover meaningful insights and implement data processing techniques, including MapReduce.

##Project Overview

The project analyses subway ridership data to answer specific questions about trends, behaviours, and other factors influencing subway usage. It also demonstrates the use of **MapReduce** for distributed data processing.

## Features

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Analyze the subway ridership dataset to identify patterns and anomalies.
   - Visualize key metrics and trends.
   
2. **MapReduce Implementation**:
   - Use MapReduce techniques to process and analyze large-scale data.

3. **Insightful Questions**:
   - Investigate questions like:
     - Does weather affect subway ridership?
     - What are the busiest stations and times?


## Requirements

### Prerequisites
1. **Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. **Required Libraries**:
   - `pandas`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `numpy`
   - `seaborn`
   - `mrjob` (for MapReduce)

## Files in the Project

- **Analyzing_data_from_the_New_York_subway.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and implementation.

## Key Insights

1. Weather patterns (e.g., rainy days) significantly impact subway ridership.
2. Peak subway usage times correspond to morning and evening commuting hours.
3. Specific stations have consistently higher ridership, driven by location and connectivity.
